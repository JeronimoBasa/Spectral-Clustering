# Spectral Clustering
 
This is a very simple Notebook in R using the package kernlab that shows you the advantage of Spectral Clustering over regular K-means in unsupervised learning. Whilst K-means is one of the most basic tools for clustering, it only relies on distances from the centroids and it doesn't take care on how these points are distributed.

On the other side, Spectral Clustering transforms the data using a similarity matrix and spectral decomposition. For reference, see
